## Support this project
Matix's Mod Installer is free and open source but developing it has taken thousands of hours of my time and a large part of my sanity. If you feel this little viewer useful to you, it would go a great way to ensuring that I can afford to take the time to continue to develop it.

Thanks for your gratitude and finance help!
